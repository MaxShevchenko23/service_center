SERVICE CENTER

This is one of my course projects. Made with love and spaghetti code <3

This software is made with WinForms and ADO.NET. It is dedicated to organize the work of service center that repairs computer electronic. 
This project has 3 roles: receiptionist, admin and worker (who actually do the main work).
Every role has it's own windows and functionality.
